# C - Dynamic libraries

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at **ALX AFRICA SE School**. I learnt about dynamic library, also called shared library. I learnt how to create and use them.

## Technologies

- C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- C files are written according to the `C90 standard`.
- tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.
